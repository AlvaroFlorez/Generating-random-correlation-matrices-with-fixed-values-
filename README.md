Code for: Generating random correlation matrices with fixed values: An application to the evaluation of multivariate surrogate endpoints

This code reproduce the results of the paper: "Generating random correlation matrices with fixed values: An application to the evaluation of multivariate surrogate endpoints". It consits of X files.

Functions.R: all functions required
Simulations.R: commands to generate all simulations, tables and figures.

The simulated random correlation matrices are stored in a folder called "Simulations 1" and the additional simulations in a folder called "Simulations 2". Therefore, it is required to create them before running the codes.

For the data analysis, it is required to download the dataset from: https://github.com/blaser-lab/Paper-Ruiz-2017.
